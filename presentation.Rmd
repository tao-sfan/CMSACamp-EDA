- given data set 
- looking for relationships within the data
- practicing eda

## Dataset

- WTA Match Data: all WTA matches between 2018 and 2021
 - courtesy of Jeff Sackmannâ€™s famous tennis repository

- each observation was a player and from there was broken down into observations of winners and losers, for example the number of aces by each player was broken down into winner_ace and loser_ace

- most common used variables
 - w_ace, l_ace, surface
 
---
## Hypothesis
#### 1) The surface type with the most aces is the hard courts.
 
#### 2) The final matches would be the longest matches
 
#### 3) Players will have a high win rate on only one of the surfaces

## Aces are most common on grass surface courts

## Recap and what is next for the WTA match data


####Aces are most common on grass courts.



####Later round matches are typically longer than earlier rounds.



####Players preform better on some surfaces than others

--

Through clustering, we can visualize groups of players that are more conservative with their serves versus players that are more aggressive.


- _Limitations:_
 - Due to the dataset separating winner and loser data, it made it difficult to explore and compare overall player performances

- _Next Steps:_ 
 - examining other player data such as second serve points and break points
 - manipulating the data to be able to compare players more easily
